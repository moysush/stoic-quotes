### Lessons Learned

- **Data Management with JSON**: I learned how to effectively store data in a JSON file and then access it within my application. Utilizing JSON files for data storage allowed me to organize and manage my quotes data efficiently, making it easily accessible for use in the Vue.js application.

- **Vue.js and Bootstrap**: Through working on this project, I deepened my understanding of Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. Integrating Vue.js with Bootstrap enabled me to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces, enhancing the overall functionality and aesthetics of my application.

### Future Development

- Add a drop-down feature to let user explore quotes of only the chosen author of their choice
